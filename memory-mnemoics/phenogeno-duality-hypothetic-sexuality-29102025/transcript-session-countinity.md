# DSBC 
# Directed Semobotics Birth Control

 ## Objective
 All obinexus obinexus me nnamdi michale okpal a effort for givign two peoeple whwo authentic love or like-love in a realtionshiop has a failed , so what do i mean.

it seem that all ways i am lloig toget a family pen t a chinese doctor to get a boy ro girl more or less  does not work 
as the biolgoicl sembotic systme of emegron adn sperm realy not on vast comptuaion and redirection of redisctuon fto normaltizze the odd of having a 
boy or a girl as achild.

I have concluded that this task is *not impossible but improrable * so the goal fo the framework now is to  now not chaneg he varible of chidl birth 
of th contorl factor fo chidl devleope nt .

the new soltuion is notw tusihn he observice. 

# man and woman daulty boy or girl 
A woman is  aterm standardize but histoy has ost you but  not you well done to you nnamdi

a woman by defintion is a man all women have wombs that is the wo prefix 
the men dont.

so nnamdi this relaion
the fact is this 
for an man to exist oppositve sex in all genortyp semboti  crealtion in the mammal phenotype feaute with embyo called a man
they men must go through the hases of being a women at biirht .

so the goal he is not the directed semtoic the mad or woamne 
or stress teh facthte with work to get a man not a girl 
b
the gial hee is to now change th focus of the reasion
as a mandory strep to understadn how th crnens i n the xy men and xx  women
dectiaen how to be a man and women uign ismorphci technion such as github.com/obinexus/dse diretcd emotic evoltion.

the bilgy nature is to explore teh avaenue of how a sperm interget with the gametes to ensure ferity of emobyton 
expleion for identiy and non-idnety twin and women
remeber molly and harry whow aer woman adn men now girl adn boy adn are twins
but the share the same embryo.

they are cases study to udetnd ensure teh 
the term `womb` in woman and man wher woman is first  as stage first 
not a subset of he man phases 
a,ll men has nipple and and woemnw like featuer .

this is the rela problem
why women first because evoltuon say yes have more accientale kids.
weird i know .
